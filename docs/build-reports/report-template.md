# Build Report: `[Ticket ID]`

**Date Completed:** `YYYY-MM-DD` **Agent:** `[Agent Name]` **Related Ticket:** `[Link to or ID of the original Build Ticket]`

### 1\. Summary of Work Completed

*A brief, one-paragraph summary of the task's objective and outcome. Describe what was built or fixed at a high level.*

**Example:**

> This report details the completion of the core backend API scaffolding. The work involved creating the initial FastAPI application structure, defining placeholder API endpoints, and configuring the necessary Dockerfile and dependency files to ensure the service is buildable and runnable within the project's Docker Compose environment.

### 2\. Files Modified or Created

*A complete list of all files that were added, modified, or deleted during this task. Use file paths relative to the project root.*

-   `backend/main.py` (Modified)
    
-   `backend/pipelines.py` (Created)
    
-   `backend/Dockerfile` (Created)
    
-   `backend/requirements.txt` (Modified)
    

### 3\. Implementation Details

*A more detailed, technical explanation of the work. Describe the "how" and "why" behind the changes. If there was any complex logic, a choice between two technologies, or a specific implementation pattern used, explain it here.*

**Example:**

> -   **FastAPI Scaffolding:** Initialized a new FastAPI app in `main.py` with a health check endpoint (`/`) and placeholder endpoints for `/api/ingest/text`, `/api/ingest/audio`, and `/api/chat` as per the project charter. Pydantic models were used for request body validation.
>     
> -   **Haystack Pipeline Module:** Created a new `pipelines.py` module to centralize RAG logic. For the MVP, an `InMemoryDocumentStore` was used to simplify initial setup and testing, with a note to replace it with `ChromaDocumentStore` later. The module defines singleton instances of the indexing and querying pipelines to prevent re-initialization on every API call.
>     
> -   **Docker Configuration:** The `Dockerfile` uses a `python:3.11-slim` base image for efficiency. The `CMD` instruction uses `uvicorn` to run the FastAPI application, binding it to `0.0.0.0` to make it accessible from outside the container.

### 4\. Testing & Verification

*A checklist or description of the steps taken to verify that the work is complete and meets the acceptance criteria from the build ticket. Include specific commands run and their expected output.*

-   \[x\] **Verified Docker Build:** Ran `docker-compose up -d --build` from the project root. The `backend` container built and started successfully.
    
-   \[x\] **Verified Health Check:** Sent a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8000/`. Received a `200 OK` response with `{"status":"ok","message":"Synapse Engine is running!"}`.
    
-   \[x\] **Verified API Documentation:** Navigated to `http://localhost:8000/docs` in a web browser. The FastAPI Swagger UI loaded correctly and displayed all defined endpoints.
    
-   \[x\] **Verified Ingestion Endpoint:** Sent a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/api/ingest/text` with a test JSON payload. Received a `200 OK` response.
    
-   \[x\] **Verified Chat Endpoint:** Sent a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/api/chat` with a test query. Received a `200 OK` response with the expected placeholder message.
    

### 5\. Issues, Blockers, or Open Questions

*A space to note any unexpected problems, dependencies that blocked progress, or questions that arose during development that may need to be addressed in a future ticket.*

-   **Issue:** None.
    
-   **Blocker:** None.
    
-   **Question:** The `pipelines.py` module currently uses an `InMemoryDocumentStore`. We will need a subsequent ticket to refactor this to use the persistent `ChromaDocumentStore` service.
