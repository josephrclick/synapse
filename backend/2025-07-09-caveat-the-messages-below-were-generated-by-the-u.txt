  requirements-dev.txt to help answer the following: - do we need multiple versions? - anything we don't need in 
  any of these files? - are we using correct package versions?

● Comprehensive Backend Requirements Audit Results

  Executive Summary

  The audit reveals that while the project uses a mature dependency management approach with pip-tools, there's
  significant room for optimization. The most critical finding is ~2GB of unnecessary ML dependencies that can be
  removed since the application uses Ollama for all ML operations.

  Critical Findings (Immediate Action Required)

  1. Massive PyTorch/CUDA Bloat 🚨

  - Issue: Full PyTorch (2.7.1) + all NVIDIA CUDA libraries are included
  - Impact: Adds 2-5GB to container images
  - Root Cause: sentence-transformers in requirements.in pulls in PyTorch
  - Evidence: In pipelines.py:263-304, the app uses OllamaDocumentEmbedder and OllamaTextEmbedder, NOT
  SentenceTransformers
  - Fix: Remove sentence-transformers>=2.2.2 from requirements.in

  2. Haystack Version Inconsistency 🚨

  - Issue: requirements.txt shows haystack-ai==2.15.2 but PyPI only has 2.0.x versions
  - Impact: Build reproducibility is broken - new developers can't set up the environment
  - Possible Causes: Private PyPI, manual editing, or forked library
  - Fix: Investigate immediately and either document private index or fix to public version

  3. Unused Direct Dependencies

  - deepgram-sdk==3.1.6: Listed but never imported (only API key in config.py:25)
  - nltk>=3.9.1: No imports found in codebase
  - accelerate>=1.8.0: Not directly used
  - Fix: Remove all three from requirements.in

  High Priority Optimizations

  1. Outdated Core Packages

  Current → Recommended:
  - pydantic==2.5.3 → 2.8.2+
  - fastapi==0.109.0 → 0.115.0+
  - uvicorn==0.27.0 → 0.34.0+

  2. Duplicate HTTP Clients

  - httpx: Used directly ✓
  - requests: Pulled by transformers (will be removed)
  - aiohttp: Pulled by deepgram-sdk (will be removed)

  Recommendations

  Immediate Actions:

  1. Create optimized requirements.in:
  # Remove these lines:
  sentence-transformers>=2.2.2  # Line 20
  deepgram-sdk==3.1.6          # Line 21
  nltk>=3.9.1                  # Line 24
  accelerate>=1.8.0            # Line 25

  2. Regenerate requirements.txt:
  pip-compile --upgrade backend/requirements.in -o backend/requirements.txt

  3. Investigate haystack-ai version issue

  Quick Wins:

  - Remove python-multipart==0.0.6 if not handling file uploads
  - Add deptry to requirements-dev.txt for automated dependency checking
  - Fix certifi version (shows 2025.6.15 - likely a typo)

  Answer to Your Questions:

  Q: Do we need multiple versions?
  A: Yes, the three-file structure is justified and follows best practices:
  - requirements.in: Source of truth for direct dependencies
  - requirements.txt: Locked versions for reproducibility
  - requirements-dev.txt: Development tools kept separate

  Q: Anything we don't need?
  A: Yes, significant cleanup possible:
  - sentence-transformers (saves ~2GB)
  - deepgram-sdk, nltk, accelerate
  - python-multipart (if no file uploads)

  Q: Are we using correct package versions?
  A: Core packages are outdated but stable. After removing unnecessary deps, run pip-compile --upgrade for latest
  security patches and features.

  Expected Benefits:

  - 70-80% reduction in container size (from ~3GB to ~600MB)
  - Faster CI/CD builds and deployments
  - Reduced security surface area
  - Lower operational costs (storage, bandwidth)
  - Clearer architecture (Ollama-only for ML)
